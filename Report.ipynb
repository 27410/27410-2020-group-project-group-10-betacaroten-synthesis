    "β-carotene belongs to the large group of caroterpernoids, also called tetraterpenoids. Caroterpernoids are organic red/orange pigments. They are found naturally in many fungi and plants as well as some algae and bacteria. β-carotene are well known for giving plants as carrots and pumkin their characteristic orange color. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Caroterpernoids are tetraterpenoids they are all produced from 8 isoprene molecules and have the chemical formula $C_{40}$$H_{x}$. Caroterpernoids devided in two classes xanthophylls and carotenes. Xanthophylls contains oxygen whereas carotenes is purely carbohydrates. β-carotene ($C_{40}$$H_{56}$) belongs in the carotene class as can be seen on the figure below. "

    "Beta-carotene is a carotenoid with numerous biological functions in the human body including beeing involved in the natural synthesis of provitamin A, among others nesessary for growth, vision and embryotic development. Beta-carotene is furthermore widely used in the industry as an additive in food, cosmetics and in the pharmacutical industry as a substance in medicine as it has shown anticancer as well as antioxidant properties. Despite the numerous functuons of beta-carotene, we are not able to synthensize it in the human body, pushing market demands for its synthetic production and effective production methods is thus of great interest. \n",

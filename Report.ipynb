    "Beta-carotene is a carotenoid with numerous biological functions in the human body including being involved in the natural synthesis of provitamin A, among others necessary for growth, vision and embryotic development. Beta-carotene is furthermore widely used in the industry as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics and an additive in medicine as it has shown anticancer as well as antioxidant properties. Despite the numerous functions of beta-carotene, we are not able to synthesize it in the human body, pushing market demands for its synthetic production. \n",
    "Chemical synthesis is as of today the most commonly used technique its production, but research has revealed that synthetic beta-carotene has carcinogenic activity and effective production methods for its natural synthesis is thus of great interest. Based on this extensive research has been caried out to examine the microbial biosynthesis of it as it provides a solid basis for a natural and sustainable production while avoiding the use of organic solvents such as heavy metals, strong acids and bases along with the formation of byproducts. Metabolic engineering has additionally carved the way to improve the yield and thus obtain higher titers and productivity of the product, through strain engineering. All though utilizing a natural producer of beta-carotene seem like the straightforward choice as production organism, it has been found that most of these are non-cultivable in laboratory conditions and that they require extensive optimalization. Choosing a well characterized microorganism, with various tools available for genetic engineering will thus enhance the chances and ease the process of increasing the product yield and productivity of the strain. \n",
    "We have utilized an existing genome scale metabolic model (GSM) for S. Cerevisiae and incorporate relevant reactions and pathways for its natural synthesis of beta-carotene. Afterwards we have performed phenotype predictions based on gene deletions and essentiality and evaluated on metabolic pathway visualizations with Escher.\n",

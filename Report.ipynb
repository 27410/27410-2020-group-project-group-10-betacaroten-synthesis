    "As it has been used and studied for many years, the genome of S. cerevisiae is a well-characterized eukaryotic genome, and is simple in identifying open reading frames. This is very relevant in the work with gene sequence model, as this makes predictions throuhg models more precise.  \n",

    "One imporant fact is that conventional S. cerevisiae can produce geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which is a precursor in the carotenoid biosynhtesis. Through genetic engineeering it has been provden possible to produe beta-carotenes in S. cerevisiae. Compared to other heterlogous beta-carotene production oganisms, it is considered safe which is important, as beta-carotenes can be used in food production etc., making it relevant as a cell factory in beta-carotene production. \n",

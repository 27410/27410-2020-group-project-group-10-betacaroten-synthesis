# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 10 - beta-carotene synthesis

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
We would like to use an excisting GMS to come up with engineering stradegies for beta-caroten production in the model organism S. Cervisiae. We are going to examine the beta caroten parthway and insert nesessary genes into the GMS. Next we will examine gene knockout target to optimize the beta-caroten production in S. Cervisiae.

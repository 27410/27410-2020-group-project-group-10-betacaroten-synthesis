# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 10 - beta-carotene synthesis

## Project summary
β-carotene has a wide range of uses including the use as an food-adjetive and a precourser for various of molecules, making it an industrial relervant molecule for cell factory optimization purposes.
We would like to use an excisting GMS to come up with engineering stradegies for β-carotene production in the model organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. We are going to examine the β-carotene parthway and insert nesessary genes into the GMS. Next we will examine gene knockout target to optimize the β-carotene production in *S. cerevisiae*. The overall aim is to achive a *S. cerevisiae* strain for the production of β-carotene for industrial use. 

## Project overview
Two GMS for *S. cerevisiae* strin S288C has been identified. To choose the best one to work with, memote will be used.
Since *S. cerevisiae*. isn't a natural producer, the nessesary gene will be identified and inserted into the model for further engineering.
Through gene knockouts and hence changinging expression levels in the β-carotene pathway we will optimize the production in *S. cerevisiae*. 
Additionally different carbon source was investigated.

To provide a better overview for the read, we have hidden the code. It can be view by pressing the "...".
